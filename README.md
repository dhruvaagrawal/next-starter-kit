# Next.js Starter Kit

This is a starter-kit, built upon the implementation by `@shadcn`, with changes custom to my workspace.
This does not contain an ORM like Prisma or Drizzle since this is free-to-use and may changes based on requirements.

npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/dhruvaagrawal/next-starter-kit
